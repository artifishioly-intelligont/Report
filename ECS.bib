abstract ={The social scientific analysis of social class is attracting renewed interest given the          accentuation of economic and social inequalities throughout the world. The most widely          validated measure of social class, the Nuffield class schema, developed in the 1970s, was          codified in the UK’s National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) and places          people in one of seven main classes according to their occupation and employment status.          This principally distinguishes between people working in routine or semi-routine          occupations employed on a ‘labour contract’ on the one hand, and those working in          professional or managerial occupations employed on a ‘service contract’ on the other.          However, this occupationally based class schema does not effectively capture the role of          social and cultural processes in generating class divisions. We analyse the largest survey          of social class ever conducted in the UK, the BBC’s 2011 Great British Class Survey, with          161,400 web respondents, as well as a nationally representative sample survey, which          includes unusually detailed questions asked on social, cultural and economic capital.          Using latent class analysis on these variables, we derive seven classes. We demonstrate          the existence of an ‘elite’, whose wealth separates them from an established middle class,          as well as a class of technical experts and a class of ‘new affluent’ workers. We also          show that at the lower levels of the class structure, alongside an ageing traditional          working class, there is a ‘precariat’ characterised by very low levels of capital, and a          group of emergent service workers. We think that this new seven class model recognises          both social polarisation in British society and class fragmentation in its middle layers,          and will attract enormous interest from a wide social scientific community in offering an          up-to-date multi-dimensional model of social class.},

abstract = "Abstract Price leadership is a concept that lacks precision. We propose a deliberately narrow, falsifiable, definition then develop it, illustrate its feasibility and test it using the two leading British supermarket chains. We find both firms engaging in leading prices upward over a range of products, with the larger being initially more dominant but the smaller increasing leadership activity to take overall leadership over time. However, more price leadership events are price reductions than price increases, consistently led by the smaller firm. Nevertheless, the increases are of larger monetary amounts than the falls, so average basket price increases over time. "
